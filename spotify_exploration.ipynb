    "### Audio Features that influence the Popularity of Songs\n",
    "* Spotify stores [audio feature information](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/tracks/get-audio-features/) for all tracks. We looked at which audio features contribute most towards a song's popularity by calculating the mean measure of each audio feature.\n",
    "* In general, songs with high **Energy** and **Danceability** are always popular.\n",
    "* **Valence**, which describes the musical positiveness conveyed by a track is also a strong contributor. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).\n",
    "* Songs that have lower **Acousticness** and **Liveness** (i.e. a song that was performed live) are generally more popular as well.\n",
    "* **Speechiness**, which detects the presence of spoken words in a track has a mean lower than 0.33, which indicates that popular songs comprise mostly of \"music\" and other \"non-speech-like\" aspects.\n",
    "* The mean **Instrumentalness** of songs is also low - which, as expected, indicates that popular songs are less instrumental and more vocal-focused.\n"
